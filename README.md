# PRODIGY_DS_05
## Overview
This project analyzes road traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and driver demographics. The goal is to uncover insights that can help improve road safety by understanding the factors that contribute to accidents.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes various attributes related to traffic accidents, such as:
* Age band of the driver
* Sex of the driver
* Educational level
* Vehicle driver relation
* Driving experience
* Lanes or medians
* Types of junction
* Road surface type
* Light conditions
* Weather conditions
* Type of collision
* Vehicle movement
* Pedestrian movement
* Cause of accident
* Accident severity
The dataset does not include a date column, so the analysis focuses on the available categorical and numerical data.

## Key Insights
* Weather Conditions: Most accidents happen in normal weather conditions. This suggests that drivers might be more careless during good weather, possibly due to a false sense of security
* Road Surface Type: The majority of accidents occur on asphalt roads, indicating that while these roads are common, they might also have characteristics that contribute to higher accident rates.
* Time of Day: Most accidents happen during the day. Increased traffic and activity during daylight hours could contribute to this pattern.
* Driver Demographics: Drivers aged 18-30 with 5-10 years of driving experience are mostly involved in accidents. This could be due to a combination of youthful risk-taking behavior and overconfidence from intermediate experience.
